# Image Deletion Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
Images were not being deleted from the "Manage Images" section in the admin dashboard.

## Root Cause
The `handleDeleteImage` function was sending the entire content object to the API, which caused issues with the update logic. The API endpoint had conditions that only updated if specific fields were provided, but the logic wasn't properly handling array updates.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed `/src/components/AdminDashboard.js`
**Changes:**
- Simplified the delete request to send only the `images` array
- Added better error handling and logging
- Added authentication check before deletion
- Improved error messages

**Key improvement:**
```javascript
// Before: Sent entire content object
body: JSON.stringify({ ...content, images: updatedImages })

// After: Send only images array
body: JSON.stringify({ images: updatedImages })
```

### 2. Improved `/src/app/api/content/route.js`
**Changes:**
- Changed condition from `if (body.images)` to `if (Array.isArray(body.images))`
- Added better logging for debugging
- Added `!== undefined` checks for all fields
- Improved error messages

**Key improvement:**
```javascript
// Before: Only updated if field was truthy
if (body.images) content.images = body.images;

// After: Properly checks if it's an array
if (Array.isArray(body.images)) {
  content.images = body.images;
  console.log('Updated images array, new length:', body.images.length);
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks Delete button** on an image
2. **Confirmation dialog** appears
3. **Image is removed** from the local array
4. **API request sent** with only the updated images array
5. **MongoDB updated** with the new images array
6. **UI refreshed** to show the updated gallery

## Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Go to Admin Dashboard
- Navigate to https://lovesory.vercel.app/admin/login
- Login with your credentials

### Step 2: Go to Images Tab
- Click the "Images" tab
- You should see your uploaded images

### Step 3: Delete an Image
- Hover over any image
- Click the "Delete" button
- Confirm the deletion

### Step 4: Verify Deletion
- Image should disappear from the gallery
- Success message should appear: "âœ… Image deleted successfully!"
- Image count should decrease

## Expected Behavior

âœ… **Before deletion:**
- Image visible in gallery
- Image count shows correct number

âœ… **After deletion:**
- Image removed from gallery
- Image count decreases by 1
- Success message appears
- MongoDB updated with new images array

## Debugging

If deletion still doesn't work:

1. **Check Vercel Logs**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Click Deployments â†’ Function Logs
   - Look for "Updated images array" message

2. **Check MongoDB**
   - Go to MongoDB Atlas
   - Select your cluster
   - Go to Collections â†’ Content
   - Verify images array is updated

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for any error messages
