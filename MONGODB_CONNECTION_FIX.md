# MongoDB Atlas Connection Fix

## Current Status
Your MongoDB connection string is properly configured in `.env.local`:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://yahyaemad999_db_user:jYVOXbdTiww6Ngos@cluster0.lmh2xxt.mongodb.net/?appName=Cluster0
```

## The Error You Encountered
The API error `401 Unauthorized` was from trying to use MongoDB Atlas API with an invalid token. **This is not needed for your application** - your app only needs the connection string, which you already have.

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Verify MongoDB Atlas IP Whitelist
Your MongoDB cluster needs to allow connections from your IP address:

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
2. Log in with your account
3. Navigate to your cluster (Cluster0)
4. Go to **Network Access** in the left sidebar
5. Click **Add IP Address**
6. Add your current IP address OR use `0.0.0.0/0` for development (allows all IPs)

### Step 2: Verify Connection String Credentials
The connection string uses:
- **Username**: `yahyaemad999_db_user`
- **Password**: `jYVOXbdTiww6Ngos`
- **Cluster**: `cluster0.lmh2xxt.mongodb.net`

Verify these credentials are correct in MongoDB Atlas:
1. Go to **Database Access** in MongoDB Atlas
2. Find user `yahyaemad999_db_user`
3. Verify the password matches (or reset if needed)

### Step 3: Test the Connection Locally
Run your development server to test:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then try to access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 4: Check Application Logs
If you still get errors, check the server logs for specific MongoDB error messages:
```bash
# The logs will show if it's a connection, authentication, or IP whitelist issue
```

## Common MongoDB Connection Errors & Solutions

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `ECONNREFUSED` | Cannot connect to MongoDB | Check IP whitelist in MongoDB Atlas |
| `Authentication failed` | Wrong username/password | Verify credentials in MongoDB Atlas Database Access |
| `ENOTFOUND` | Invalid cluster URL | Check cluster name in connection string |
| `ETIMEDOUT` | Connection timeout | Add your IP to MongoDB Atlas Network Access |
| `MongoServerError: connect ECONNREFUSED` | Cluster not running | Verify cluster is active in MongoDB Atlas |

## For Vercel Deployment
When deploying to Vercel, you need to:

1. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to your Vercel project
   - Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add `MONGODB_URI` with your connection string

2. Whitelist Vercel's IP addresses in MongoDB Atlas:
   - Go to MongoDB Atlas Network Access
   - Add `0.0.0.0/0` (for development/testing)
   - Or add specific Vercel IPs for production

## Quick Verification Checklist

- [ ] MongoDB Atlas account is active
- [ ] Cluster0 is running (check MongoDB Atlas dashboard)
- [ ] Your IP address is whitelisted in Network Access
- [ ] Username and password are correct
- [ ] Connection string format is correct
- [ ] `.env.local` file exists with MONGODB_URI
- [ ] No typos in connection string

## Next Steps

1. **Immediately**: Add your IP to MongoDB Atlas Network Access
2. **Then**: Run `npm run dev` and test the application
3. **If still failing**: Check the terminal output for specific error messages
4. **For production**: Set up Vercel environment variables and whitelist Vercel IPs
